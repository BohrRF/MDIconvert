convert mid file into my data structure and play it with adjustable parameters and a simple visualization based on DOS window.

This is a MIDI extention of my other repo LeapHand.

1. Drop .mid file into command line window and hit enter key, midi file will be read and basic information will be printed out.
2. After all outputs ended, press enter kry again to start midi replay.
3. While music playing
    Arrow key up/down      -- Changing replay bpm or change bpm by keep tapping enter key at desirable bpm. 
    Arrow key left/right   -- Changing offset, which can dajust synchronization of the music and your enter key tapping.
    Space key              -- Pause/resume music play.
    Esc key                -- Stop current midi file replay, ready for next midi file.
    Window close bottom    -- Stop the execution.
